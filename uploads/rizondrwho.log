Jan 25 23:14:57 <ComputerTech>	when i try to upload a 3mb file to my file shairng site
Jan 25 23:15:28 <ComputerTech>	i get error 413 Request Entity Too Large
Jan 25 23:15:31 <ComputerTech>	not sure why tbh
Jan 25 23:15:37 <ComputerTech>	https://github.com/computertech312/eliteupload
Jan 25 23:15:41 <ComputerTech>	https://share.computertech.co
Jan 25 23:15:44 <ComputerTech>	any ideas?
Jan 25 23:17:49 <drwho>	this is with flask?
Jan 25 23:17:56 <ComputerTech>	yeah
Jan 25 23:18:09 <drwho>	directly or are you using something like nginx and wsgi
Jan 25 23:18:19 <ComputerTech>	no directly running flask
Jan 25 23:18:20 <ComputerTech>	well
Jan 25 23:18:23 <ComputerTech>	nginx reverse proxy via nginx
Jan 25 23:18:24 <ComputerTech>	so
Jan 25 23:18:24 <ComputerTech>	hm
Jan 25 23:18:42 <ComputerTech>	app.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH'] = 100 * 1024 * 1024  # 100MB
Jan 25 23:18:46 <ComputerTech>	is what i have in app.py
Jan 25 23:18:50 <ComputerTech>	to prevent it being an issue
Jan 25 23:18:51 <ComputerTech>	but
Jan 25 23:18:51 <ComputerTech>	hm
Jan 25 23:19:10 <drwho>	yeah that is what I am seeing to do in the official documentation
Jan 25 23:19:11 <drwho>	https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/patterns/fileuploads/
Jan 25 23:19:33 <ComputerTech>	so what am i doing wrong then
Jan 25 23:19:34 <ComputerTech>	:v
Jan 25 23:20:18 <drwho>	look at your nginx.conf
Jan 25 23:20:24 <drwho>	and instead client_max_body_size
Jan 25 23:20:33 <drwho>	s/instead/increase
Jan 25 23:20:34 <ComputerTech>	oh
Jan 25 23:20:35 *	ComputerTech looks
Jan 25 23:20:54 <drwho>	https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-bsd-nginx-413-request-entity-too-large/
Jan 25 23:21:32 <ComputerTech>	not a thing inside my nginx.conf
Jan 25 23:21:38 <ComputerTech>	maybe i need to put it in the reverse proxy?
Jan 25 23:21:51 <drwho>	possibly
Jan 25 23:21:53 <ComputerTech>	hm
Jan 25 23:22:08 <drwho>	also try doing it with the dev flask server and then through the nginx reverse proxy
Jan 25 23:22:15 <drwho>	that should tell you what is blocking
Jan 25 23:22:21 <ComputerTech>	ahh
Jan 25 23:22:23 <ComputerTech>	good idea ye
Jan 25 23:25:02 <ComputerTech>	yep
Jan 25 23:25:04 <ComputerTech>	that did the trick
Jan 25 23:25:05 <ComputerTech>	thx mate
Jan 25 23:25:05 <ComputerTech>	<3
Jan 25 23:25:10 <drwho>	no problem
